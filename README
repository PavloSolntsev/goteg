GObject TEmplate Generator (GOTEG) was written to help me with writing templates for new classes 
using object-oriented model provided by the glib library. There are many possible approaches to do 
this. Documentation of glib provides good explanation how to do this, but some moments were found 
to be unclear to me. Also, I don't like to type a lot every time when I create a new object. I hope, 
this script will be useful for other people too. All templates were written inside the script. 

Enjoy!
